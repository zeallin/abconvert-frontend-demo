![ecommerce_github_banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3018c781-0969-45a1-b8bb-3f638aa4260d)

## Requirements

- You must use Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the project.

- You may use any additional libraries, **but UI libraries that do not integrate with Tailwind CSS are not allowed.**

- While this is a frontend-focused challenge, you should write backend code if necessary (e.g., for SSR/SSG or handling API requests).

- Deploy the project to a publicly accessible URL.

- Extra features that go beyond the requirements and impress us are encouraged!

## Project Description

This is a minimalistic e-commerce project built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Task 1: E-Commerce Website

- Build an e-commerce website based on the wireframe provided in the `assets` folder.
- Design the UI and layout freely—do not limit yourself to a specific theme or style.
- Add interactivity: Users must be able to add items to a shopping cart. Each user’s cart should be unique and persist independently (e.g., using local storage, cookies, or a backend solution).
- For inspiration, you can refer to this [website](https://themes.shopify.com/). Feel free to draw ideas from its design or functionality, but do not copy it directly.

## Task 2: Preview and Content Editor

- Create an A/B test settings page that includes a live preview of the e-commerce site from Task 1 (e.g., via an iframe or embedded view).
- Enable users to interact with the preview by clicking on specific UI elements (e.g., buttons, product descriptions) to mark them as areas for A/B testing.
- Implement an A/B test on pricing: Split users into two groups upon visiting the site, with each group seeing different prices for the same products. You may choose the grouping method (e.g., random assignment, cookies, or URL parameters).
- Integrate an LLM (e.g., via an API like OpenAI) to generate A/B test ideas and content variations for the selected areas, including pricing variations for testing.
- Allow users to apply these LLM-generated suggestions (including price changes) directly to the e-commerce site, updating the live preview dynamically.
- Finally, these changes must actually affect the Task 1 website and be reflected when it is accessed.

Note: OpenAI API Key will be provided along with your interview instructions.
